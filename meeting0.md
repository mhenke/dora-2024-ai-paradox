### Facilitator Preparation
*   [ ] Ensure the key questions are visible (e.g., on a whiteboard or shared document).

### Agenda
Introduction & Context (5 min)
*   Set the context—this book club is about critical analysis of AI's impact, not just praise. The DORA report identified major trade-offs that we will explore.

---

Review Pre-Work & Current Friction Points (15 min)
*   Capture collective answers on the whiteboard regarding individual AI usage, recent production incidents, and perceived organizational priority stability. Focus discussion on identifying the greatest current friction point in delivery.

---

Define Core Metric for Tracking AI Impact (10 min)
*   As a team, decide on one quantitative metric (e.g., Change Failure Rate, PR Size, Deployment Frequency) that the group will track over the course of the book club to measure AI's impact.

### Key Questions
*   What AI tools are we relying on today (and why)?
*   Where is our greatest current friction point in delivery (the real bottleneck)?
*   What is the current team-wide consensus on trust in AI-generated code?
*   How stable do our organizational priorities feel? (1-5 scale)
