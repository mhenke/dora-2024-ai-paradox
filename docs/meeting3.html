<h1>Meeting 3: Lessons from Experiments</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This meeting is dedicated to reviewing the results of the experiments committed to in Meeting 2. We will discuss findings, identify key lessons learned, and determine next steps for continuous improvement based on the DORA metrics.</p>
<h2>Reading Required</h2>
<p>Experiment data (from the team's tracking of the agreed-upon metric).</p>
<h2>Facilitator Guide Details</h2>
<p><strong>Date</strong>: [Date] | <strong>Duration</strong>: 30 min</p>
<h3>Facilitator Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Ensure experiment data is collected, visualized, and ready for presentation.</li>
<li>[ ] Prepare a template for documenting lessons learned and next steps.</li>
<li>[ ] Be ready to guide the team in proposing new experiments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p>Review Experiment Results (15 min)</p>
<ul>
<li>Present the data collected from the experiment (e.g., changes in PR size, change failure rate, deployment frequency). Discuss whether the hypothesis was supported or refuted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Discuss Lessons Learned (10 min)</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate a discussion on what the team has learned about the AI Paradox, the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy, and the impact on team dynamics or delivery performance.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Determine Next Steps &amp; Future Experiments (5 min)</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the lessons learned, decide on concrete next steps. This could include continuing the current experiment, modifying it, or proposing new experiments to further address the AI Paradox or other identified friction points.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What were the results of our experiment? Did we observe the expected outcome?</li>
<li>What key lessons can we draw from these results regarding AI's impact and our mitigation strategies?</li>
<li>What are the recommended next steps for our team based on these findings?</li>
<li>What new experiments should we consider for continuous improvement?</li>
