# The DORA AI Paradox: Facilitator Guide

**Duration**: 6 weeks total (3 meetings + 1 checkpoint)
**Meeting Frequency**: Every 2 weeks
**Format**: 60-minute discussions

## Overall Theme & Learning Objectives

**Core Tension**: AI's immediate benefits versus its complex downstream consequences.

**Guiding Question**: How can we maximize the organizational and individual benefits of AI adoption while proactively managing the unexpected trade-offs, particularly the $\downarrow -7.2\%$ drop in software delivery stability?

### Learning Objectives:

*   Establish baseline understanding of current AI usage and delivery friction.
*   Critically analyze the AI Paradox: improved processes leading to worse outcomes.
*   Identify and test the core drivers: Batch Size and Stable Priorities.
*   Commit to actionable experiments using DORA's continuous improvement framework.

## Recommended Follow-Up Actions

**After Meeting 2:**

*   **MANDATORY**: Document the experiment commitment clearly, including the specific DORA metric being tracked.
*   Set calendar reminder for check-in/Meeting 3.
*   Begin tracking agreed-upon metrics (e.g., average PR size, change failure rate).
