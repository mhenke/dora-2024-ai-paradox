<h1>The AI Paradox: Visual Summary</h1>
<p>From the 2024 DORA Accelerate State of DevOps Report</p>
<h2>The Central Tension</h2>
<p>AI ADOPTION CREATES TWO OPPOSING FORCES:</p>
<p>✓ CLEAR BENEFITS              vs.        ⚠ UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES
(Individual &amp; Process Level)              (Delivery &amp; Stability Level: ↓ 7.2%)</p>
<h2>What's Working: The Benefits</h2>
<h3>Individual Level (per 25% increase in AI adoption)</h3>
<p>Productivity        ↑ +2.1%
Flow state          ↑ +2.6%
Job satisfaction    ↑ +2.2%</p>
<p>BUT: Time on valuable work ↓ −2.6%  ⚠</p>
<h3>Process Level</h3>
<p>Code quality           ↑ +3.4%
Documentation quality  ↑ +7.5%
Code review speed      ↑ +3.1%
Approval speed         ↑ +1.3%
Code complexity        ↓ −1.8%</p>
<h3>Team &amp; Organization Level</h3>
<p>Team performance           ↑ +1.4%
Organizational performance ↑ +2.3%
Product performance        → +0.2% (minimal change)</p>
<h2>What's Broken: The Contradiction</h2>
<h3>Delivery Performance (per 25% increase in AI adoption)</h3>
<p>⚠ Software delivery stability  ↓ −7.2%  (MAJOR DECLINE)
⚠ Software delivery throughput ↓ −1.5%  (minor decline)</p>
<h3>The Paradox:</h3>
<p>Historically, better code quality + faster reviews = better delivery performance</p>
<p>With AI: Better processes → WORSE delivery stability</p>
<p>This shouldn't happen!</p>
<h3>The Leading Hypothesis</h3>
<p>AI → Faster code writing → Larger changelists → Lower stability</p>
<p>DORA's Basic Principle: Small batch sizes = Fast + Stable
AI may be causing us to forget this principle</p>
<h3>The Vacuum Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Why does AI increase productivity but DECREASE time on valuable work?</p>
<p>BEFORE AI:
[████████ Valuable Work: 60%] [█████ Toil: 40%]</p>
<p>AFTER AI:
[███████ Valuable Work: 57%] [█████ Toil: 40%] [? Mystery: 3%]</p>
<p>Theory: AI helps us finish valuable work FASTER, creating a time vacuum.
That vacuum gets filled with... meetings, interruptions, context switching.
AI doesn't reduce TOIL (meetings, bureaucracy) - it just speeds up the good stuff.</p>
<h3>The Trust Paradox</h3>
<p>39.2% of developers report little or no trust in AI-generated code</p>
<p>YET</p>
<p>75.9% rely on AI for at least one task</p>
<p>Why? Low trust doesn't stop usage - people just verify and modify the output.
&quot;Mostly correct&quot; code that needs tweaking is valuable enough to use.</p>
<h3>The Alternative Path: User-Centricity</h3>
<p>DORA's Surprising Finding:</p>
<p>&quot;When organizations focus on the user, stability and throughput of software
delivery are not a requirement for product quality.&quot; (p. 59)</p>
<p>Traditional Path to Success:
Fast delivery + Stable delivery = High-performing product</p>
<p>Alternative Path to Success:
Deep user understanding = High-performing product
(even with imperfect delivery metrics)</p>
<h3>Four behaviors of user-centric teams:</h3>
<p>✓ Incorporate user feedback to reprioritize features</p>
<p>✓ Know what users want to accomplish</p>
<p>✓ Believe user experience is key to business success</p>
<p>✓ Treat user experience as top priority</p>
<h3>The Priority Stability Problem</h3>
<p>Unstable organizational priorities lead to:
• Meaningful DECREASE in productivity
• Substantial INCREASE in burnout</p>
<p>This effect persists even with:
✓ Strong transformational leadership
✓ High-quality internal documentation
✓ User-centric approach</p>
<p>Fix: Stabilize priorities (easier said than done)</p>
<h2>AI Adoption Statistics</h2>
<h3>Organizations:</h3>
<p>• 81% have shifted priorities to increase AI incorporation
• AI prioritization varies by org size (smaller = faster adoption)
• No meaningful difference by industry vertical</p>
<h3>Individuals:</h3>
<p>• 75.9% rely on AI for at least one task
• Top uses: Writing code (74.9%), Summarizing info (71.2%)
• 75% report positive productivity gains
• 39.2% report little/no trust in AI code quality</p>
<h2>The Future Outlook: Mixed Feelings</h2>
<p>Respondents expect AI will have POSITIVE impact on:</p>
<p>Product quality (in 1, 5, and 10 years)</p>
<p>Respondents expect AI will have NEGATIVE impact on:</p>
<p>Their own careers (peaks at 5 years)</p>
<p>Society as a whole (peaks at 5 years)</p>
<p>The environment (peaks at 5 years)</p>
<p>The Disconnect: Short-term experience is positive, but long-term expectations are pessimistic.</p>
<h2>The DORA Continuous Improvement Cycle</h2>
<ol>
<li>Identify area to improve
↓</li>
<li>Measure baseline
↓</li>
<li>Develop hypotheses
↓</li>
<li>Commit to a plan  ← OUR BOOK CLUB ENDS HERE
↓</li>
<li>Do the work
↓</li>
<li>Measure progress
↓</li>
<li>REPEAT ↻</li>
</ol>
<p>Key Insight: &quot;The best teams are those that achieve elite improvement,
not necessarily elite performance.&quot;</p>
<h2>Key Questions for Discussion</h2>
<h3>Meeting 1: Benefits &amp; Paradox</h3>
<p>Where does the AI-freed time actually go?</p>
<p>Is code quality truly better, or just easier to work with?</p>
<p>Why the disconnect between current gains and future pessimism?</p>
<h3>Meeting 2: Detriments &amp; Strategy</h3>
<p>Are our batch sizes increasing with AI?</p>
<p>Can we measure this?</p>
<p>How user-centric are we really?</p>
<p>How stable are our priorities?</p>
<p>What experiment will we commit to?</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>AI IS TRANSFORMATIVE, BUT COMPLEX:</p>
<p>✓ Individuals feel more productive, satisfied, and in flow
✓ Code quality, documentation, and reviews improve
⚠ But delivery stability takes a significant hit
⚠ And valuable work time mysteriously decreases</p>
<p>THE CHALLENGE:
Maximize benefits while managing trade-offs through:
• Small batch sizes (DORA's core principle)
• User-centricity (alternative path to quality)
• Stable priorities (foundation for well-being)
• Continuous improvement (the only path forward)</p>
