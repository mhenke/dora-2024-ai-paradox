# Meeting 3: Lessons from Experiments

## Overview
This meeting is dedicated to reviewing the results of the experiments committed to in Meeting 2. We will discuss findings, identify key lessons learned, and determine next steps for continuous improvement based on the DORA metrics.

## Reading Required
Experiment data (from the team's tracking of the agreed-upon metric).
